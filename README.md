# Test Management System
This is a test management system that runs on Python in the terminal. It provides functionalities to manage student information, test details, and track student absences. The system allows adding new students with their email ID, register number, and name, modifying student details using the register number, adding new tests with their type, date, subject code, and subject name, and recording absences for each test. The system can display students who have been absent for three or more tests, find exams on which a particular student was absent using their register number, and trace students who were absent for a particular subject.
